# KanonGraph Configuration File
# https://github.com/yourusername/kanongraph
#
# This is an example configuration file. Copy it to your project root
# and customize as needed.

# Scanning options
scan:
  # Patterns to exclude from scanning (glob patterns)
  exclude_patterns:
    - "**/test/**"
    - "**/tests/**"
    - "**/examples/**"
    - "**/.terraform/**"
    - "**/vendor/**"
  
  # Continue scanning even if some files fail to parse
  continue_on_error: false
  
  # Maximum depth for recursive directory scanning
  max_depth: 100

# Analysis options
analysis:
  # Flag exact version constraints (e.g., "= 1.0.0")
  # These prevent automatic patch updates
  check_exact_versions: true
  
  # Flag pre-release versions (e.g., "1.0.0-beta")
  # Pre-release versions may be unstable
  check_prerelease: true
  
  # Flag constraints without upper bounds (e.g., ">= 1.0")
  # These may allow breaking changes
  check_upper_bound: true
  
  # Flag modules older than this many months
  # Set to 0 to disable
  max_age_months: 12

# Output options
output:
  # Use colored output in terminal
  colored: true
  
  # Enable verbose output (show all modules/providers)
  verbose: false
  
  # Pretty-print JSON output
  pretty: true

# Git options (for cloning repositories)
git:
  # Authentication token (can use environment variable)
  # Uncomment and set your token, or use KANONGRAPH_GIT_TOKEN env var
  # token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
  
  # Branch to checkout (default: repository's default branch)
  # branch: main

# Policy rules - customize these based on your organization's standards
policies:
  # Require version constraints on all modules
  # Recommended: true
  require_version_constraint: true
  
  # Require upper bounds on all version constraints
  # More strict - prevents any major version upgrades
  require_upper_bound: false
  
  # Allowed provider patterns (empty = allow all)
  # Use glob patterns to restrict which providers can be used
  # allowed_providers:
  #   - hashicorp/*
  #   - terraform-aws-modules/*
  #   - cloudposse/*
  
# Deprecation tracking for modules and providers
# Mark specific version ranges as deprecated with custom messages
